## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. bioinformatician and experienced technical leader with a track record of
success across biotech, diagnostics, and research environments.
My career spans leadership roles at Caris Life Sciences, Form Bio, Karius, DNAnexus, and
UCSF, where I've guided teams in developing validated clinical assays and scalable data
infrastructure.
As the creator of widely-adopted open-source tools like CNVkit and a significant
contributor to Biopython, I combine deep scientific expertise with practical software
engineering skills across the full spectrum of computational biology -- from design of
experiment, to NGS analysis and variant intepretation, to data science and cloud
architecture.

## What I do

I provide strategic guidance and implementation expertise in multi-omic data management,
genome interpretation, and cloud technology strategy for precision medicine initiatives.
I specialize in designing reproducible bioinformatics workflows, regulatory-compliant
pipelines (CAP/CLIA/FDA), and scalable data architectures that transform complex
biological datasets into actionable insights.
I'll work with you to deliver tailored solutions for your organization -- whether you
need scientific analysis, end-to-end pipeline development, data infrastructure
optimization, or technical leadership to accelerate your bioinformatics capabilities and
innovation goals.
