## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. bioinformatician and experienced technical leader with a track record of
success across biotech, diagnostics, and research environments. My career spans
leadership roles at Caris Life Sciences, Form Bio, Karius, DNAnexus, and UCSF, where
I've guided teams in developing validated clinical assays and scalable data
infrastructure. As the creator of widely-adopted open-source tools like CNVkit and a
significant contributor to Biopython, I combine deep scientific expertise with practical
software engineering skills across the full spectrum of computational biology -- from
NGS analysis and variant intepretation to data science and cloud architecture.

## What I do

As a consultant, I provide strategic guidance and implementation expertise in multi-omic
data management, genome interpretation, and cloud technology strategy for precision
medicine initiatives. I specialize in designing reproducible bioinformatics workflows,
regulatory-compliant pipelines (CAP/CLIA/FDA), and scalable data architectures that
transform complex biological datasets into actionable insights. My technical versatility
allows me to deliver tailored solutions for organizations advancing cell and gene
therapeutics, cancer diagnostics, synthetic biology, and infectious disease
detection -- whether you need end-to-end pipeline development, data infrastructure
optimization, or technical leadership to accelerate your bioinformatics capabilities and
innovation goals.
